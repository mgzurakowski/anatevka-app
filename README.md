# Anatevka

So here it is, after such a long time. Sorry for the delay (it was all because of life's perturbations), again. Code is a bit messy 'cause at the beginning I wanted to use Tailwind (it was good opportunity to learn it), but later I decided to rewrite it using no external CSS/JS librariers and frameworks. Oh, I used normalize.css, but in my opinion it's must have :P

App's name is inspired by absolutely awesome old movie titled "Fiddler on the Roof" (which is one of my all-time favourites). There's song titled "Sunrise, Sunset", but this name would be too long and also it's not so creative. BUT there's another song "Anatevka" and it's name of the village where the movie takes place. Ta daa ðŸŽ‰ 

As I said at the job interview in both previous and current work I wasn't writing a tests ("BeCauSe tHERE's No TImE foR SUCh THInGs", januszsoft style), and looks like I must refresh my memory. That's why I'll add the tests (probably) in the evening, but I don't want to pretend I have super-duper knowledge in matter of writing tests.
